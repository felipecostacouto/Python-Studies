Sure! Here are the problems listed in bullet points:

Prime Numbers in a Range

Description: Write a function that takes two integers, start and end, and returns a list of all prime numbers between start and end (inclusive).
Function Signature: def primes_in_range(start, end):
Example: print(primes_in_range(10, 30)) # Output: [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
Sum of Digits

Description: Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the sum of its digits.
Function Signature: def sum_of_digits(n):
Example: print(sum_of_digits(1234)) # Output: 10
Palindrome Number

Description: Write a function that checks if a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Function Signature: def is_palindrome(n):
Example: print(is_palindrome(121)) # Output: True
print(is_palindrome(123)) # Output: False
Fibonacci Sequence

Description: Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Function Signature: def fibonacci_sequence(n):
Example: print(fibonacci_sequence(10)) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Description: Write a function that takes two integers and returns their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
Function Signature: def gcd(a, b):
Example: print(gcd(48, 18)) # Output: 6
Least Common Multiple (LCM)

Description: Write a function that takes two integers and returns their least common multiple.
Function Signature: def lcm(a, b):
Example: print(lcm(4, 6)) # Output: 12
Armstrong Number

Description: Write a function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
Function Signature: def is_armstrong(n):
Example: print(is_armstrong(153)) # Output: True (153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3)
print(is_armstrong(123)) # Output: False
Prime Factorization

Description: Write a function that returns the prime factorization of a given integer.
Function Signature: def prime_factors(n):
Example: print(prime_factors(56)) # Output: [2, 2, 2, 7]
Binary to Decimal Conversion

Description: Write a function that converts a binary number (given as a string) to a decimal number.
Function Signature: def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):
Example: print(binary_to_decimal("1101")) # Output: 13
Decimal to Binary Conversion

Description: Write a function that converts a decimal number to a binary number (returned as a string).
Function Signature: def decimal_to_binary(n):
Example: print(decimal_to_binary(13)) # Output: "1101"
These problems should provide a good variety of coding exercises to practice different concepts and improve your programming skills.
